## About
Oftentimes, leaving for university is the first time that many students are on their own. They are displaced from their existing support systems and thrown into an unfamiliar environment. Instead of navigating the new territory blindly, this project aims to provide students a platform to ask questions and seek advice from other students who have gone through the same situations. It is a place for students to safely voice questions or concerns to just to find a common ground with others.
