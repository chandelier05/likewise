## About
Oftentimes, leaving for university is the first time that many students are living independently on their own. They are displaced from their existing support systems and thrown into an unfamiliar environment. This can be a very overwhelming feeling because college introduces many new stressors to the individual. Students might feel lost and may lack the awareness necessary to tackle newfound problems. Instead of navigating the new territory blindly, this project aims to provide students a supportive platform and space to ask questions and seek advice from other students who have gone through the same situations. It is a place for students to safely voice questions or concerns to just to find a common ground with others.

There are currently very little resources at the University of Washington structured around providing a space for students to seek advice from others. Many events such as Q&A sessions for specific topics occur but this project hopes to offer students to ask for advice at any given time. Moreover, by taking the time to voice stressors or understand what other people are going to, a new level of connection and understanding for other people can occur.

## What to expect
* Documentation for the project including code and research data that we collect
* Interactive web-based social platform of some sort to invite understanding and interaction between students who feel estranged or disconnected or just want to seek advice from other students
* We are currently deciding on how we want to conduct user research and finding possible inspirations for the layout of our landing page. Our next steps following this stage will help us decide how we want to prioritize developing the features for our website.
